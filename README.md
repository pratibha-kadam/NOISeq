# NOISeq
## NOISeq- R Script for Analysis of RNA-seq Expression without replicates.
RNA-seq is done with biological replicates but for some tools it is difficult to anlyze it without replicataes.
Here, NOISeq is a bioconductor package which allows analysis of such RNAseq data with/without replicates.Exploratory plots to evualuate saturation, count distribution, expression per chromosome, type of detected features, features length, etc. Differential expression between two experimental conditions with no parametric assumptions.

The provided R Script is for analysis of RNAseq expression data without replicates.
